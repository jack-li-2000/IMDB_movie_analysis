# movies_industry_portfolio_project
An analysis of the movie industry using python and jupyter notebook. 

In this analysis, we look at different features scraped from the IMDb website for movies before and including 2020. First performing data cleaning and organization, then exploring the dataset, and finally looking at correlations between features and gross earnings of movies. 

Future steps include performing principle component analysis to remove multicollinearity in features to allow for regression analysis in the data.
